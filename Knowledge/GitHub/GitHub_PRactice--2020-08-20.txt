- if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you’re checking out, Git won’t let you switch branches.
- Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a “fast-forward.”
Basic Merge Conflicts
	- Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn’t been resolved is listed as unmerged
	- The version in HEAD
		• Top part of that block (everything above the =======)
		• Hile the version in your iss53 branch looks like everything in the bottom part
