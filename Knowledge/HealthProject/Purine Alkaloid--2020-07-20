	Introduction
		- Examples: Caffeine, cocaine and nicotine
	
	Purine Alkaloid Structure
		- Alkaloids are secondary metabolites that have diverse structures
		- All alkaloids contain nitrogen and are classified as organic compounds
		- The purine alkaloids are a distinct form that have a nitrogen containing ring structure resembling that of purine
	 	- Pseudoalkaloids, as they are not derived from amino acids like true alkaloids
		- The aromatic structure makes them recalcitrant to degradation
		- Purine alkaloid catabolism are N-demethylase and xanthine oxidase
	
	Key Microorganisms
		- Pseudomonas
		- Serratia
		- Rhodococcus
		- Most well studied is P. putida
			- Shaped, flagellated, gram negative bacterium
			- Possesses a diverse range of aerobic metabolism
			- Observed living in caffeine concentrations of 50g/L
			- Related to a specific transmissible plasmid found in caffeine-resistant strains of Pseudomona
			- Because of its unique abilities to break down aromatic hydrocarbons and its nonpathogenic nature, this bacterium has high potential for bioremediation
	
	Significance
		- Activity of alkaloids can affect major chemical transmitters such as epinephrine
		- Can cause antagonist effects such as cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications
		- These are generated during the production of coffee and tea and discharged into water sources where they can be used as nutritional resources, but only if they are void of caffeine
	
	Current Research
		- The genes for these NdmA and NdmB enzymes have been pinpointed to a specific genomic DNA fragment, which also contains genes 
		  for NdmD (the enzyme responsible for electron transfer from NADH) and NdmC (an N-7 demethylase) (8). The knowledge of these enzymes
		  could have vast bioremediation applications, as well as provide a leeway to the discovery of new N-demethylases
