Python testing in Visual Studio Code
Enable a test framework
	- To enable testing, use the Python: Configure Tests
	- You can also configure testing manually by setting one and only one of the following settings to true: python.testing.unittestEnabled, python.testing.pytestEnabled, and python.testing.nosetestsEnabled
	
	- Test discovery#
	    Test discovery applies the discovery patterns for the current framework (which can be customized using the Test configuration settings)
		• Python.testing.unittestArgs
			- Looks for any Python (.py) file with "test" in the name in the top-level project folder
		• Python.testing.pytestArgs
			- Looks for any Python (.py) file whose name begins with "test_" or ends with "_test", located anywhere within the current folder and all subfolders

	- Run tests#
		• Python Test Log
		• View > Output menu command to show the Output panel, then select Python Test Log from the drop-down on the right side):
	- Run tests in parallel
		• Pytest-xdist
		• Py -3 -m pip install pytest-xdist
		• Next, create a file named pytest.ini
		• For example, to set it up for 4 CPUs:
			- [pytest]  addopts=-n4
	- Debug tests
		• To customize settings for debugging tests, you can specify "request":"test" in the launch.json
