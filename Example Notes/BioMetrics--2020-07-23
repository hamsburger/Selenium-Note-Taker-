Biometrics are a way to measure a person’s physical characteristics to verify their identity
	- Face recognition
	- Iris recognition
		• Although widely used in security applications, it isn’t typically used in the consumer market
	- Fingerprint scanner
		• Captures the unique pattern of ridges and valleys on a finger
	- Voice recognition
	- Hand geometry
	- Behavior characteristics
A biometric system consists of three different components:
	- Sensor
		• Records
		• Reads it when your biometric information needs to be recognized
	- Computer
		• Storing the information for comparison
	- Software
		• Connects the computer hardware to the sensor
